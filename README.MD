We recommand you to read our technical articles on [Medium](https://medium.com/@luc.claustres) as a source of inspiration:

The Kalisio framework is also inspired by our experience in developing [Weacast](https://weacast.gitbooks.io/weacast-docs/), refering to it as a more simple project might help.
